Azure Cloud based Minecraft setup :)

## Plans
- **Azure Container Instance** running linux minecraft server
  - 15 GB limit for container size
  - started & stopped on demand via bot
  - does not have persistence when not running
- **Azure Blob Storage** for backups [Plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/access-tiers-overview?tabs=azure-portal)
  - should have space for up to 3 backups at minimum (~ 500MB for a small world, don't know how large they get)
  - plan might not matter too much for our needs
- **Azure Cloud Function**
  - Implements bot functionality (either directly when using discord bot or indirectly for telegram bot)
  - Starting a container based with a function: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-tutorial-azure-function-trigger
- **Telegram** or **Discord bot** for administration
  - telegram has a polling-based model, i.e. a bot actively runs an event loop, reacting to interactions
    - [node-telegram-bot-api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-telegram-bot-api) node.js lib
  - discord has a web hook based model (push-based), i.e. it could be run in an Azure Cloud Function itself
